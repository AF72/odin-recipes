        seasoned ground beef, tomatoes, onions, and garlic. Enjoy these flaky, deep-fried empanadas as 
        an appetizer, a main dish, or even after your main course.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon Goya Extra Virgin Olive Oi</li>
        <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>½ medium yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup Goya Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>6 Goya Spanish Olives Stuffed with Minced Pimientos, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Goya Sofrito</li>
        <li>1 packet Sazon Goya with Coriander and Annatto</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Goya Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Goya Dried Oregano</li>
        <li>Goya Ground Black Pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package yellow or white Goya Discos empanada discs, thawed</li>
        <li>1 quart Goya Corn Oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            Add ground beef; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 
            about 10 minutes. Add onions and cook until soft, 
            about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, olives, sofrito, 
            sazón, garlic, oregano, and pepper. Reduce the heat to 
            medium-low and simmer until mixture thickens, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Roll empanada disks on a lightly floured surface until 1/2 inch 
            larger in diameter. Spoon about 1 tablespoon meat mixture into 
            the middle of each disk. Moisten the disk edges with water, 
            fold in half over filling to form a half-moon, and pinch to seal 
            (or seal with a fork).</li>
        <li>
            Heat 2 1/2 inches corn oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan 
            to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Working in batches, fry empanadas
             until crisp and golden brown, flipping once, 4 to 6 minutes. 
             Transfer to paper towels to drain.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>La Cocina Goya Cooking Tip:</h2>
    <p>Crispy empanadas, guaranteed! If you don't have a deep-fry thermometer, 
        you can still estimate the temperature of the oil. Just place the handle
         of your wooden spoon (or a wooden chopstick) into the oil. If a steady 
         stream of bubbles emerges from the wood, the oil is perfect. If the oil 
         starts rapidly bubbling, or if only a few bubbles are present, then the 
         oil is too hot or too cold, respectively.</p>
